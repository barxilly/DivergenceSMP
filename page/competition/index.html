        <p class="pageText">The Fan Art Competition is a competition where you can submit your best fan art of the
            Divergence SMP!</p>
        <p class="pageText">The fan art can be anything, from a sculpture to a song! Or something like this amazing
            piece of art by Koffi:</p>

            screenshots from the Divergence SMP!</p>
        <p class="pageText">You might have to do some digging to find the best moments, but it will be worth it!</p>

        <h2 class="pageHeading">Fan Build Competition</h2>
        <p class="pageText">The Fan Build Competition is a competition where you can submit your best builds of the
            Divergence SMP!</p>
        <p class="pageText">The builds can be anything, from a recreation of the spawn to a mini recreation of the
            entire world!</p>
        <p class="pageText">The builds will be judged on creativity, detail, and overall quality.</p>
